Learning new things can be hard.
What makes it fun is sharing the newly acquired knowledge with others, trying to verbalise the matter, and simplify it.
Even better: collaboratively learning concepts even [deepens our understanding](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1980-33312-001) of them.
But this could be achieved without adding to the infinite content of the Internet.

If I use my favourite search engine to look for an explanation of a mathematical theorem I came across, or an installation guide for some weird new software I want to try out, nine times out of ten (figuratively speaking) it is always the small, user-generated content that is the most useful.
Because often, if I don't understand something, someone else has had the same problem already.
And if that person is willing to share that knowledge, then everyone benefits, right?

Addtionally, I was inspired by Ness Labs' ["Case for Learning in Public"](https://nesslabs.com/learning-in-public) to start this blog.
This blog is about reflecting on what I am learning and what interests me.
It also serves as an archive of my journey, documenting the various adventures I undertake.
Algorithmic Tales is a creative outlet, a reminder to always be curious and experiment with the unknown.

It may even help you find like-minded people, or help others along the way.
At the very least, it is something to work on and tinker with.
